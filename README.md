# NumToBinary Program

## Overview
`NumToBinary` is a Java program that takes an integer input from the user and processes it to generate a series of numbers based on the binary representation of each digit. It also calculates the sum of the generated numbers and prints the result.

## Features
- Accepts an integer input from the user.
- Processes each digit of the number and generates a binary-like sequence.
- Displays the generated numbers and their sum.

## How the Code Works
1. **Input**: The program prompts the user to enter an integer.
2. **Processing**:
   - It iterates through each digit of the input number.
   - For each digit, it generates a sequence of numbers where each position is multiplied by powers of 10.
   - The binary-like numbers are stored in an array.
3. **Output**:
   - The generated sequence of numbers is printed.
   - The sum of the sequence is calculated and displayed.

## Example
### Input:

Enter a number: 245

### Output:

1 1 1 10 10 100 100 100 100 
Sum = 422
